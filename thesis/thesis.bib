abstract = {This article examines the physician-patient agency relationship in the context of the prescription drug market in Japan. In this market, physicians often both prescribe and dispense drugs and can pocket profits in so doing. A concern is that, due to the incentive created by the markup, physicians' prescription decisions may be distorted. Empirical results using anti-hypertensive drugs suggest that physicians' prescription choices are influenced by the markup. However, physicians are also sensitive to the patient's out-of-pocket costs. Overall, although the markup affects prescription choices, physicians appear more responsive to the patient's out-of-pocket costs than their own profits from markup.},

abstract = {Abstract Differentiated products demand systems are a workhorse for understanding the price effects of mergers, the value of new goods, and the contribution of products to seller networks. Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995) provide a flexible random coefficients logit model which accounts for the endogeneity of prices. This article reviews and combines several recent advances related to the estimation of BLP-type problems and implements an extensible generic interface via the PyBLP package. Monte Carlo experiments and replications suggest different conclusions than the prior literature: multiple local optima appear to be rare in well-identified problems; good performance is possible even in small samples, particularly when “optimal instruments” are employed along with supply-side restrictions. If Python is installed on your computer, PyBLP can be installed with the following command: pip install pyblp.Up-to-date documentation for the package is available at https://pyblp.readthedocs.io.},

The primary methodology is to assume that demand can be described by a discrete-choice model and that prices are endogenously determined by price-setting firms. In contrast to some previous empirical work, the techniques explicitly allow for the possibility that prices are correlated with unobserved demand factors in the cross section of markets. The article proposes estimation by "inverting" the market-share equation to find the implied mean levels of utility for each good. This method allows for estimation by traditional instrumental variables techniques.},

These estimates can be obtained using only widely available product-level and aggregate consumer-level data, and they are consistent with a structural model of equilibrium in an oligopolistic industry.

 abstract = {Background. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee deemed the second-generation antihistamines (SGA) safe for over-the-counter use against the preliminary opposition of the manufacturers. As a result, loratadine is now available over-the-counter. First-generation antihistamines (FGA) are associated with an increased risk of unintentional injuries, fatalities, and reduced productivity. Access to SGA over-the-counter could result in decreased use of FGA, thereby reducing deleterious outcomes. The societal impact of transitioning this class of medications from prescription to over-the-counter status has important policy implications. Objective. To examine the cost-effectiveness of transitioning SGA to over-the-counter status from a societal perspective. Research Design. A simulation model of the decision to transition SGA to over-the-counter status was compared with retaining prescription-only status for a hypothetical cohort of individuals with allergic rhinitis in the United States. Estimates of costs and effectiveness were obtained from the medical literature and national surveys. Sensitivity analysis was performed using a second-order Monte Carlo simulation. Main Outcome Measures. Discounted, quality-adjusted life-years saved as a result of amelioration of allergic rhinitis symptoms and avoidance of motor vehicle, occupational, public and home injuries and fatalities; discounted direct and indirect costs. Results. Availability of SGA over-the-counter was associated with annual savings of $4 billion ($2.4-5.3 billion) or $100 ($64-137) per allergic rhinitis sufferer and 135,061 time-discounted quality-adjusted life years (84,913-191,802). The sensitivity analysis provides evidence in support of these results. Conclusion. Making SGA available over-the-counter is both cost-saving and more effective for society, largely as a result of reduced adverse outcomes associated with FGA-induced sedation. Further study is needed to determine the differential impact on specific vulnerable populations.},

 abstract = {This article examines the influence of insurance coverage on the selection of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescribed $({\rm R}_{{\rm x}})$ medicines in treating less serious health problems. Because health insurance policies typically provide no coverage for OTC products, a low list price for an OTC may exceed the after-insurance expense associated with a much higher-priced prescription. Under these circumstances, rational individuals with insurance will choose prescribed medicines even if OTCs are equally effective. Ten common health problems typically managed with either R x or OTC medicines were selected for analysis. The study population consists of elderly Pennsylvanians surveyed during 1990 who reported suffering one or more of these conditions (N = 2,962). Multivariate analysis confirmed that 1) people with prescription coverage are significantly more likely to medicate a given problem than are those without it; and 2) given the decision to medicate, the presence of insurance significantly increases the level of R x use and significantly reduces the level of OTC use. As expected, the effect was strongest among people with the most complete prescription insurance coverage. The article discusses the implications of these findings in the context of national health reform and Food and Drug Administration policy regarding ${\rm R}_{{\rm x}}\text{-to-}{\rm OTC}$ switches.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper provides an analysis of the benefits to society from the conversion of nicotine replacement drugs (nicotine patches and gum) in 1996 from sale by prescription only in the United States to over-the-counter (OTC) sales. To estimate these benefits, we first estimate statistical demand functions for nicotine patches and gum. Second, we calculate the effects of OTC conversion on sales of each type of nicotine replacement drug. Third, we survey the literature on the effects of nicotine replacement drugs on total quits of cigarette smoking. Fourth, we survey the literature on the effects of quits achieved on expected lifespan, and on the estimated monetary value of longer lives from smoking cessation. Finally, we use all this evidence to calculate the value of the social benefits of the OTC conversion to the US. As a result of the OTC conversion, consumption of nicotine replacement drugs has increased substantially, by 78–92\% for nicotine patches and 180\% for nicotine gum. We estimate that the resulting increase in smoking cessation generated annual net social benefits of the order of magnitude of \$1.8–2 billion, based on conservative estimates both of the number of quits achieved and the value of added quality-adjusted life years from the reduced smoking.

We begin by articulating a simple set of “canonical” assumptions under which the econometrics of DiD are well-understood. We then argue that recent advances in DiD methods can be broadly classified as relaxing some components of the canonical DiD setup, with a focus on (i) multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, (ii) potential violations of parallel trends, or (iii) alternative frameworks for inference. Our discussion highlights the different ways that the DiD literature has advanced beyond the canonical model, and helps to clarify when each of the papers will be relevant for empirical work. We conclude by discussing some promising areas for future research.}

keywords = {prescription drugs, non-linear pricing, instrumental variables, price elasticities},
abstract = {Abstract The price elasticity of demand for prescription drugs is a crucial parameter of interest in designing pharmaceutical benefit plans. Estimating the elasticity using micro-data, however, is challenging because insurance coverage that includes deductibles, co-insurance provisions and maximum expenditure limits create a non-linear price schedule, making price endogenous (a function of drug consumption). In this paper we exploit an exogenous change in cost-sharing within the Quebec (Canada) public Pharmacare program to estimate the price elasticity of expenditure for drugs using IV methods. This approach corrects for the endogeneity of price and incorporates the concept of a ‘rational’ consumer who factors into consumption decisions the price they expect to face at the margin given their expected needs. The IV method is adapted from an approach developed in the public finance literature used to estimate income responses to changes in tax schedules. The instrument is based on the price an individual would face under the new cost-sharing policy if their consumption remained at the pre-policy level. Our preferred specification leads to expenditure elasticities that are in the low range of previous estimates (between −0.12 and −0.16). Naïve OLS estimates are between 1 and 4 times these magnitudes. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary Empirical estimates of price elasticities of demand (PED) for pharmaceuticals suggest that they are relatively price inelastic. However, in many settings, a medication and its substitutes and complements face simultaneous differential changes in prices that affect the observed “composite” PED. We exploit an implementation of a value-based formulary (VBF) that utilized drug-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) to inform drug copayments, resulting in increases in copayments for some medications and decreases in copayments for others. We first show theoretically that by changing the price of a medication and its substitute in opposite directions, VBF designs can leverage cross-price effects to increase the range of composite PEDs. We then empirically estimate PED and welfare effects using a consumer surplus approach. Overall PED was −0.16, similar to the RAND Health Insurance Experiment estimate. However, there was substantial dispersion of PED across the VBF copayment tiers ranging from −0.09 to −0.87 with a statistically significant trend aligned with the levels of value as reflected by the ICER estimates (p < 0.001). The net welfare increase was \$147,000 for the cohort or \$28 per member over the postpolicy year. Further experimentations of VBF designs with alternative cost-effectiveness thresholds, copayment levels and value definitions could be quite promising for improving welfare.},
